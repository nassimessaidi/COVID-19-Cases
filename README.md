This simple HTML/CSS page contains 6 boxes showing the cases renaming as below:
- **`New Cases`:** It displays daily cases every day at 18:00 (GMT +1), the current date corresponding to this day showing on the top page.
- **`New Recovered`:** It contains daily recovered people.
- **`New Deaths`:** Daily deaths.
- **`Total Cases`:** The total number of COVID cases since the start of the pandemic including the deaths and recovered people.
- **`Total Recovered`:** The total number of Recovered people since the start of the pandemic.
- **`Total Deaths`:** The total number of Recovered people since the start of the pandemic.

## Note
This is just a simple test page made in a few minutes, Therefore it is not a responsive design. I made it just for testing a Python script on the deployment environment.

**PS**:I will publish that script later.

## Usage
Emm:thinking:, well. C'mon :unamused: It's just a simple lines of code anyone can do it. So, of course, it's totally free for personal use.
